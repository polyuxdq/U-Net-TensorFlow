# train mode
probability sampling: which part are more important for the training
all sampling: go through all the samples
(may combine two together)

# One problem: center always be more frequent because of the size -> draw the 3D graphs of data

# test mode
meaningless to test each epoch, waste of time

# dice coefficient

# gpu acceleration
batch size of 2, parallel computing
read paper! do not think by self

more idea with code reading
